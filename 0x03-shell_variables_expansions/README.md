## In this project I learned few new things about linux

*most linux distro have a file called /etc/bashrc or /etc/bash_profile. this files contain settings variables for the bash shell
they are called "global" or "environment" variables . some users will want to modify,add,remove some of the settings . this can 
happen on a file /home/someuser/.bashrc those variables created there called "local" variables because they only affects a user
session not the hole system
